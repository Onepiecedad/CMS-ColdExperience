Keep the new headless CMS — do not restore the old CMS project.
Please focus on integrating the new CMS with the existing React site.

Integration requirements:

The React app must read all content directly from the JSON files stored in the repo (no external API).

No separate dev-server or runtime is needed.

The CMS handles content editing, versioning, and deployment only (Git-first workflow).

The existing auto-translation workflow (n8n + GitHub push) must remain active and update EN/DE/PL automatically whenever Swedish changes.

Once integrated:

The live site must build using the CMS-managed content files.

All pages and sections (Home, Experiences, About, FAQ, Contact, Gallery, etc.) must pull their data from the CMS structure.

✅ Please make sure the CMS covers all existing pages and sections currently live on www.coldexperience.se
 — not just the homepage.

The CMS must allow editing of all text, images, and structured content for every page in all four languages (SV, EN, DE, PL).

Pages & Collections to include

Global Settings (content/site.json)
Navigation, footer, social links, contact info, global SEO.

Home (content/pages/home.json)
Hero (title, subtitle, CTA, video/image), highlights, featured experiences.

Experiences (content/experiences/*.json)
Each experience (snowmobile, aurora hunt, dog sled, accommodation, etc.):
title, summary, long description, gallery, priceFrom, duration, season, itinerary[], includes[], notIncluded[], SEO metadata.

About (content/pages/about.json)
Title, description, team section, image/video.

Packages (content/pages/packages.json)
Optional: list of package offers (title, summary, price, CTA).

Gallery (content/pages/gallery.json)
Image list + optional captions or categories.

FAQ (content/faq/*.md)
Question + answer in markdown.

Contact (content/pages/contact.json)
Title, description, phone, email, address, map location, CTA.

Blog / News (content/blog/*.md)
Optional for future use — title, date, body, featured image.

Behavior & Localization

Every page/collection must exist in all four languages (SV/EN/DE/PL).

Swedish (sv.json) acts as master for auto-translation via n8n (DeepL/OpenAI).

Translation automation updates en.json, de.json, and pl.json automatically when Swedish content changes.

Maintain a consistent key-based structure (home.hero.title, faq.q1.title, etc.).

Technical Setup

Continue using Decap CMS (Git-based, not API-based).

CMS hosted on https://coldexperience.se/admin
 (preferred)
or on admin.coldexperience.se if Git Gateway is already configured.

All content written to JSON/MD files inside the repo:
/content/, /i18n/, /public/media/.

Site rebuilds automatically via Vercel on commit.

Images uploaded in CMS → saved to /public/media/.

Deliverables / Updates Requested

Extend the current CMS config (config.yml) to include all pages and sections above.

Ensure all multilingual i18n files (sv/en/de/pl) are connected.

Keep the existing Git-first workflow (no external database).

Keep all existing documents (README.md, INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, etc.) but update them to reflect the full-site scope.

Keep the auto-translation pipeline and glossary integration intact.

Once updated, confirm:

✅ All pages from www.coldexperience.se
 are editable in CMS.

✅ All content lives as JSON/MD files under /content.

✅ Build & deploy cycle still works end-to-end.
